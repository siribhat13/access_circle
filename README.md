The Smart Identity Ring is a next-generation solution designed to replace traditional student ID cards with an intelligent, secure, and wearable NFC-based system. The project aims to address critical issues associated with plastic ID cards—such as breakage, loss, misuse, and lack of traceability—by embedding a unique NFC identifier into a durable ring mapped to each student's profile. This ring enables real-time, contactless authentication at campus checkpoints (like gates, libraries, hostels), enhances security, and reduces manual verification. Additionally, AI-powered models are integrated to detect anomalies in usage patterns, predict attendance behavior, and generate adaptive permissions based on roles and context. The system includes a robust backend (Supabase/PostgreSQL), live dashboards for administrators, and continuous learning loops to refine accuracy. With this innovation, the project envisions a campus ecosystem where identity verification is smart, seamless, and secure.
